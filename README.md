# weather-app
A React web app that allows the user to search for weather data using the open weather API.

What I learned:
- How to use promises, .then, and the newer async/await features to make fetch requests
- How the JavaScript event loop works 
- How to handle JSON data given by a RESTful api
- React Hooks
- How to use the Web Storage API
